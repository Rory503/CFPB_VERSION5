# üõë RESTART THE APP TO GET THE FIX!

## The Problem

You're still seeing "Upload Your Own CSV" selected because **the Streamlit app is still running the OLD CODE**.

My fixes won't work until you restart the app!

## ‚úÖ DO THIS NOW:

### Step 1: STOP the Current App

**In your terminal/command prompt window:**
1. Find the window where Streamlit is running
2. Press **Ctrl + C** to stop it
3. Wait for it to fully stop

### Step 2: START the App Again

```bash
streamlit run web_dashboard.py
```

Or double-click: **`start_dashboard.bat`**

### Step 3: Refresh Your Browser

**Press F5** or click the refresh button

### Step 4: Verify the Sidebar

You should NOW see:
- ‚úÖ **"CFPB Data Available"** in GREEN
- ‚úÖ **"Load data for past: 4"** (or any number 1-6)
- ‚úÖ **"Analysis Type: Quick Analysis (Use Existing Data)"** ‚Üê THIS SHOULD BE SELECTED BY DEFAULT NOW!

### Step 5: Click "Start Analysis"

It should work now!

## üéØ Why This Happened

Streamlit loads the code when it starts. My changes are in the files, but your app is still running the old version from memory.

**RESTART = FRESH START = MY FIXES LOADED** ‚úÖ

## ‚ö†Ô∏è About That Jekyll Error

The Jekyll error you showed is **UNRELATED** - it's from GitHub trying to build documentation, not from your CFPB app. Ignore it for now.

Focus on restarting your Streamlit app!
